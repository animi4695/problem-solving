In order to improve your beverage making operations you want to create a system for tracking the beverages still needing to be made when the scouts come to update you on their orders.
As part of your system you want to track the following

number_of_stores: The number of stores is the amount of scouts with stores open, where an open store is any scout who currently has a non-zero order size
number_of_orders: The total number of orders for all scouts, noting that an order with 100 quantity is still 1 order
number_of different beverages: The number of different beverages that you need to make
• • number_of_beverages: The total number of beverages that you need to make,
seen as the total of all the orders
• number_of_each_beverage: The number of beverages per beverage type across all stores
You will constantly need to maintain that your orders abide to the limits being set, limits can be updated and are defined as
numberOfStores: The total number of stores can can be open
perBeverageTotal: For each beverage, across all stores the total number of beverages that are required
If an order would exceed the limit (when compared with a >) then the order should be ignored and you should print reject_order: ‹uniqueld>
If updating the limit would cause your limits to be exceeded, then you should close all stores, resetting all your orders.
Note: If no limits have been supplied then the limits should all be treated as 0. Scouts will regularly come and update you with what beverages they need, each time they do this it will replace the previous order for the same type of beverage for that scout:

uniqueld: the unique identifier for this order
storeId: the unique identifier for the scouts corner stand
beverageName: the name of the beverage they're updating the order of
quantity: the amount of this beverage that they still require

In addition to this, if a scout's store goes out of business they will tell you their storeld and that all their orders should be cancelled, alternatively, if the total number of beverages for a given scout goes to 0 then that store is also considered out of business.

Note: If an orders size is zero then that order is no longer considered active and does not count towards number_of_orders.
You will need to implement the following functions
UpdateLimits (numberOfStores, perBeverageTotal)
Updates the limits of your business
If on doing so any of the limits are exceeded then you should close all stores
OrderUpdate (storeId, beverageName, quantity)
Updates the given stores order for a given beverage name
prints "reject_order: ‹uniqueld> in the case that it exceeds any of the limits
CloseStore (storeId)
Closes the given store removing any orders
PrintState()
prints the current state in the format "number_of_stores:
‹number_of_stores>, number_of_orders: ‹number_of_orders›, number_of_different_beverages:
‹number_of_different_beverages›, number_of_beverages:
number_of.
_beverages>"
